# Object Detection Models in Google Colab
This repository contains code for implementing and using four popular object detection models in Google Colab. 
These models are useful for detecting objects within images and can be applied to various computer vision tasks.
# Models Included
Faster R-CNN
YOLO (You Only Look Once)
SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)
RetinaNet
# Description of Each Model
# 1. Faster R-CNN
Faster R-CNN is a region-based convolutional neural network designed for object detection.
It introduces the Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network.
Known for high accuracy but relatively slower inference compared to other models.
# 2. YOLO (You Only Look Once)
YOLO is a real-time object detection system that frames object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities.
It divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each grid cell.
Known for its speed and efficiency in real-time detection tasks.
# 3. SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)
SSD detects objects in images using a single deep neural network, eliminating the need for the region proposal stage.
It uses anchor boxes at different aspect ratios and scales to detect objects of varying sizes.
Balances accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time applications.
# 4. RetinaNet
RetinaNet is a one-stage object detection model that introduces the Focal Loss to handle class imbalance during training.
It uses a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with a ResNet backbone to detect objects at different scales.
Achieves high accuracy, especially on small objects, with a moderate inference speed.
